# TwitterAuth
Simple iOS App with Twitter Authentication

For more information about the twitter authentication, please see https://fabric.io/kits/ios/twitterkit/summary.

All I did here was create a new xcode project, then ran `pod init` and added the Fabric and Twitter dependancies to the Pod File. After doing `pod install` these are downloaded and an .xcworkspace file is generated which is then used to open the new project.

From there you simply follow the set up instructions in the link above and BOOM. You have twitter auth on a cocoa pod
